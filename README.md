## ðŸ”¹ Project Objectives  
- Import, load, and view dataset  
- Display dataset summary and descriptive statistics  
- Implement **Linear Regression** for prediction  
- Implement **Bayesian Logistic Regression** and **SVM** for classification  
- Implement **K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hierarchical Clustering** for unsupervised learning  
- Perform **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction  
- Implement **HMM (Hidden Markov Models)** for sequential data prediction  
- Implement **CART Decision Trees** for categorization  
- Apply **Ensemble Learning models** for classification

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project locally or in Google Colab.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-End-to-End-Project.git
cd ML-End-to-End-Project
```

### 2. Create virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux / macOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

- On Windows (cmd):
```bat
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then open the desired notebook inside the `notebooks/` folder and execute cells step by step.
