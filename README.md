## ðŸ”¹ Project Objectives  
- Import, load, and view dataset  
- Display dataset summary and descriptive statistics  
- Implement **Linear Regression** for prediction  
- Implement **Bayesian Logistic Regression** and **SVM** for classification  
- Implement **K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hierarchical Clustering** for unsupervised learning  
- Perform **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction  
- Implement **HMM (Hidden Markov Models)** for sequential data prediction  
- Implement **CART Decision Trees** for categorization  
- Apply **Ensemble Learning models** for classification
