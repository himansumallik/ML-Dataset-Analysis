#Machine Learning End-to-End Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using a single dataset. It covers data preprocessing, statistical exploration, supervised and unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, sequential modeling, and ensemble methods.

ðŸ”¹ Project Objectives

Import, load, and view dataset

Display dataset summary and descriptive statistics

Implement Linear Regression for prediction

Implement Bayesian Logistic Regression and SVM for classification

Implement K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hierarchical Clustering for unsupervised learning

Perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction

Implement HMM (Hidden Markov Models) for sequential data prediction

Implement CART Decision Trees for categorization

Apply Ensemble Learning models for classification

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy â†’ data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn â†’ visualization

Scikit-learn â†’ regression, classification, clustering, PCA, ensemble learning

PyMC / Statsmodels â†’ Bayesian models

hmmlearn â†’ Hidden Markov Models
